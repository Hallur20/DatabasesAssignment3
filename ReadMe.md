<h2>1. Twitter data</h2>
<p>We have completed 4 out of 5 queries, which can be seen down below. The problem with the 5th query was that we did not manage to
 obtain the users who were mentioned in the text. 
</p>

```javascript

//how many twitter users:
{$group: {"_id" : "$user"}},
        {$group:{"_id" : null, "totalAmountOfUsers":{$sum: 1}}}

//most active twitter users (top 10):
{$group:{_id : "$user", number : {$sum : 1}}},
        {$sort : {number: -1}},
        {$limit: 10}

//how many grumpy twitter users (top 5):
{$match: {polarity : 0}},
        {$group: {_id: "$user", polarity : {"$sum" : 1}}},
        {$project : {"user" : 1, "polarity" : 1}},
        {$sort : {polarity: -1}},
        {$limit: 5}
        
 //how many happy twitter users (top 5):
 {$match: {polarity : 4}},
        {$group: {_id: "$user", polarity : {"$sum" : 1}}},
        {$project : {"user" : 1, "polarity" : 1}},
        {$sort : {polarity: -1}},
        {$limit: 5}

//most users who link other twitter users (top 10)
{$match: {text: /@\w*/}},
        {$group: {_id: "$user", number : {"$sum" : 1}}},
        {$sort : {number : -1}},
        {$limit: 10}
        
```

The results were these:

<h2>brief arguments</h2>
<p>we agreed that atomicity is important in all the 3 models, because of the fact that the depended steps have to happen at the same time, or else it will fail. Sharding made sense in ancestors/materialized because they are able to being split into smaller databases, while nested sets is more vulnarable because it wants to be static. Indexes works well with ancestors/materialized because of the index being able to act as a foreign key in other collections. We believe that a large number of collections would work well with nested sets because of the fact that is not much desire for storing tree nodes in the model. A collection with many documents works better for materialized/ancestors because they are more open for modification </p>

<p>we were not sure if the project was supposed to be included but if u need it to work type npm install in gitbash and remove comments etc...</p>
